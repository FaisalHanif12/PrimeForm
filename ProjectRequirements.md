Phase 2 – Home Pages

AI-Generated Fitness & Diet Plans:

User inputs goals (muscle gain, weight loss, strength).

AI generates personalized workout routines + diet plans.

Progress Trackers:

Track workouts completed, calories burned, weight updates.

Display progress in golden-highlighted charts & animations.

services/ for API calls.

hooks/ for custom logic.

store/ for state management.

Backend:

controllers/ for business logic.

routes/ for endpoints.

models/ for schemas.

middleware/ for auth/validation.

config/ for DB setup.

5. 🌍 External Considerations

App Store / Play Store compliance for design + payments.

Scalability: APIs + database must handle future features.

Data Privacy: JWT, password hashing, GDPR compliance.

Performance: Optimize animations, caching for AI responses.



Background: A very deep navy blue to black gradient.

Text/Accents: Golden gradient (from soft gold → bright yellow gold) giving a glowing elite vibe.

Input Fields & Buttons: Transparent / glassmorphism style with subtle navy overlays and glowing edges.

Extra Elements:

Logo & headers: Silver → White gradient (metallic).

Links (“Forgot Password?”): Golden text (not gradient, just flat gold).

⚡ In short → It’s Navy Blue + Black for background, with Golden gradient accents, mixed with a glassmorphism style for inputs/buttons.
